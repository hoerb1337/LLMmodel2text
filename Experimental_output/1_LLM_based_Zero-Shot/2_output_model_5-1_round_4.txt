######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The process begins when we receive a customer request for a loan amount. This is represented by the start event "Receive Customer Request for Loan Amount". 

Once the request is received, the process moves to the service task "Invoke Risk Assessor". This task represents the action of assessing the risk associated with the loan request. 

After the risk assessment, the process reaches an exclusive gateway named "If". This gateway represents a decision point in the process where the flow of control can take one of several paths based on the outcome of the risk assessment. 

If the risk assessment indicates a high risk, the process moves to the end event "Deny", which represents the action of denying the loan request. This path is represented by the sequence flow "high risk". 

If the risk assessment indicates a low risk, the process moves to the end event "Approve", which represents the action of approving the loan request. This path is represented by the sequence flow "low risk". 

If the loan request is large or the risk requires review, the process moves to the service task "Invoke Loan Approval". This task represents the action of invoking a loan approval process. This path is represented by the sequence flow "large loan or review risk". 

After the loan approval process, the process moves to the end event "Return Approval Response", which represents the action of returning the approval response to the customer. This path is represented by the sequence flow from "Invoke Loan Approval" to "Return Approval Response". 

This completes the description of the process.
