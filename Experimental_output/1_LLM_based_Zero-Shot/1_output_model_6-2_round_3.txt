######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The given BPMN model describes a procurement process involving two participants: "Supplier" and "Assembler AG". 

The process for "Assembler AG" starts on the 1st of each month. This is represented by the start event named "1st each month". After the start event, the task "Create Order" is executed. This task involves creating an order for the required goods or services. Once the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier". This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" to "Process Order".

On the "Supplier" side, the process starts with the task "Process Order". This task involves processing the order received from "Assembler AG". After the order is processed, the next task is "Send Invoice". This task involves sending an invoice for the processed order back to "Assembler AG". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" to "Receive Invoice".

Back on the "Assembler AG" side, the task "Receive Invoice" is executed after receiving the invoice from the "Supplier". This task involves receiving and processing the invoice. Once the invoice is received and processed, the process ends. This is represented by the end event.

In summary, the process involves "Assembler AG" creating an order on the 1st of each month and sending it to the "Supplier". The "Supplier" processes the order and sends an invoice back to "Assembler AG". "Assembler AG" then receives and processes the invoice, after which the process ends.
