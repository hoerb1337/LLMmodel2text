######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Loan Requests" process begins when a customer sends a request for a loan amount. This is represented by the start event "Receive Customer Request for Loan Amount". 

Once the request is received, the process moves to the service task "Invoke Risk Assessor". This task represents the action of assessing the risk associated with the loan request. 

After the risk assessment, the process reaches an exclusive gateway named "If". This gateway represents a decision point in the process where the flow of control will diverge based on the risk assessment. 

If the risk is high, the process will follow the sequence flow named "high risk" and reach the end event "Deny". This end event represents the action of denying the loan request due to high risk. 

If the risk is low, the process will follow the sequence flow named "low risk" and reach the end event "Approve". This end event represents the action of approving the loan request due to low risk. 

If the loan is large or the risk needs review, the process will follow the sequence flow named "large loan or review risk" and reach the service task "Invoke Loan Approval". This task represents the action of invoking a loan approval process for large loans or loans with risk that needs review. 

After the loan approval process, the process reaches the end event "Return Approval Response". This end event represents the action of returning the approval response to the customer. 

In summary, this process model represents a loan request process where the loan request is received, the risk is assessed, a decision is made based on the risk assessment, and the decision is communicated back to the customer.
