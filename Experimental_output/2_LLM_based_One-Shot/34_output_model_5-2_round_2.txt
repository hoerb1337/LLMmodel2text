A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Vacation Request 1.0" serialised in XML:\n                 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<bpmn:definitions xmlns:bpmn="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL" xmlns:bpmndi="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/DI" xmlns:dc="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DC" xmlns:di="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DI" xmlns:modeler="http://camunda.org/schema/modeler/1.0" id="Definitions_12ezxwz" targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn" exporter="Camunda Modeler" exporterVersion="5.11.0" modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud" modeler:executionPlatformVersion="8.2.0">\n  <bpmn:collaboration id="Collaboration_00ysc3x">\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_1bz00hb" name="Vacation Request 1.0" processRef="Process_1hn2uxf" />\n  </bpmn:collaboration>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_1hn2uxf" isExecutable="true">\n    <bpmn:laneSet id="LaneSet_1hwdigb">\n      <bpmn:lane id="Lane_1n933pm" name="Employee">\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_0zd80m9</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_0ct056h</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_0yafu3t</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n      </bpmn:lane>\n      <bpmn:lane id="Lane_09o8qey" name="Boss">\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_19gfqo5</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_06o03mj</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Gateway_0zjhyi4</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n      </bpmn:lane>\n      <bpmn:lane id="Lane_0v8xugs" name="Human Resource Assistant">\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_1bzqmzl</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_1tsa3fo</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n      </bpmn:lane>\n    </bpmn:laneSet>\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_0zd80m9" name="Start">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0r4ekz3</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_0ct056h" name="Register Vacation Request">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0r4ekz3</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_085ltgc</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:serviceTask id="Activity_19gfqo5" name="Verify Available Vacation Days">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_085ltgc</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0ur7g8a</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:serviceTask>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_06o03mj" name="Check Vacation Request">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0ur7g8a</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1tywisx</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_0zjhyi4">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1tywisx</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_19ypldc</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0p6n7v8</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:exclusiveGateway>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_0yafu3t" name="Review Rejection Reason">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_19ypldc</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0w0l1ln</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_1bzqmzl" name="Make Administrative Task">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0p6n7v8</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_06xsayd</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:endEvent id="Event_1tsa3fo">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_06xsayd</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0w0l1ln</bpmn:incoming>\n    </bpmn:endEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0r4ekz3" sourceRef="Event_0zd80m9" targetRef="Activity_0ct056h" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_085ltgc" sourceRef="Activity_0ct056h" targetRef="Activity_19gfqo5" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0ur7g8a" sourceRef="Activity_19gfqo5" targetRef="Activity_06o03mj" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1tywisx" sourceRef="Activity_06o03mj" targetRef="Gateway_0zjhyi4" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_19ypldc" name="No" sourceRef="Gateway_0zjhyi4" targetRef="Activity_0yafu3t" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0p6n7v8" name="Yes" sourceRef="Gateway_0zjhyi4" targetRef="Activity_1bzqmzl" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0w0l1ln" sourceRef="Activity_0yafu3t" targetRef="Event_1tsa3fo" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_06xsayd" sourceRef="Activity_1bzqmzl" targetRef="Event_1tsa3fo" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n                 \n                 Corresponding textual process description for the BPMN model "Vacation Request 1.0": '}]

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Vacation Request 1.0" process involves three main lanes as participants: "Employee", "Boss", and "Human Resource Assistant". A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool and extends the entire length of the Pool, either vertically or horizontally. Lanes are used to organize and categorize Activities.

The process starts with the "Employee" with the start event "Start". A start event indicates where a particular process will start. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Register Vacation Request". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves the employee registering a vacation request.

Once the vacation request is registered, it is sent to the "Boss" for verification. This is represented by the service task "Verify Available Vacation Days". A Service Task is a task that uses some sort of service, which could be a Web service or an automated application. The Boss verifies the available vacation days for the employee.

After verification, the Boss checks the vacation request, which is represented by the task "Check Vacation Request". Following this, the process reaches an exclusive gateway. An Exclusive Gateway is used to model a decision in the Process. It is basically a decision node where one of several paths can be taken.

If the vacation request is rejected, the process goes back to the "Employee" for the task "Review Rejection Reason". If the vacation request is approved, the process moves to the "Human Resource Assistant" for the task "Make Administrative Task".

Finally, the process ends after either the rejection reason is reviewed by the Employee or the administrative task is made by the Human Resource Assistant. This is represented by the end event following these tasks. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.

In summary, the process involves an employee registering a vacation request, the Boss verifying available vacation days and checking the vacation request, a decision on the vacation request, and either a review of the rejection reason by the Employee or an administrative task by the Human Resource Assistant.
