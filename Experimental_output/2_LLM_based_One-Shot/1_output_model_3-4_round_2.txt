A message start event waits for receiving a message from a Participant to start the Process.\n\nOnce the request is received, the process moves to the service task "Invoke Risk Assessor". A Service Task is a Task that uses some sort of service, which could be a Web service or an automated application. \n\nAfter the risk assessment, the process reaches an exclusive gateway named "If". A diverging Exclusive Gateway (Decision) is used to create alternative paths within a Process flow, whereas only one of the paths can be taken. In this case, the gateway represents a decision point in the process where the flow of control will diverge based on the risk assessment. This gateway thereby defines a default flow. \n\nIf the risk is high, the process will follow the default sequence flow named "high risk", and reach the throwing message end event "Deny". This type of End event indicates that a Message is sent to a Participant at the conclusion of the Process.\n\nIf the risk is low, the process will follow the sequence flow named "low risk" and reach the throwing message end event "Approve". \ns\nIf the loan is large or the risk needs review, the process will follow the sequence flow named "large loan or review risk" and reach the service task "Invoke Loan Approval".\n\nAfter the loan approval process, the process reaches the throwing message end event "Return Approval Response". \n\nIn summary, this process model represents a loan request process where the loan request is received, the risk is assessed, a decision is made based on the risk assessment, and the decision is communicated back to the customer.\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Survey" serialised in XML:\n                 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<bpmn:definitions xmlns:bpmn="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL" xmlns:bpmndi="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/DI" xmlns:dc="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DC" xmlns:di="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DI" xmlns:modeler="http://camunda.org/schema/modeler/1.0" id="Definitions_0avwck9" targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn" exporter="Camunda Modeler" exporterVersion="5.11.0" modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud" modeler:executionPlatformVersion="8.2.0">\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0iqqkdv" isExecutable="true">\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_125xekq" name="Send Questionnaire">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_10qjp5p</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_13hpysg">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_10qjp5p</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1nuv4ku</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1wrf9jy</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:exclusiveGateway>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_10qjp5p" sourceRef="Activity_125xekq" targetRef="Gateway_13hpysg" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1wrf9jy" sourceRef="Gateway_13hpysg" targetRef="Gateway_0g66doz" />\n    <bpmn:eventBasedGateway id="Gateway_0g66doz">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1wrf9jy</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0nctwvk</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1r74ggu</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:eventBasedGateway>\n    <bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent id="Event_0qahgbr" name="Filled Questionnaire Received">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0nctwvk</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0yc90va</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_0qe6kg1" />\n    </bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0nctwvk" sourceRef="Gateway_0g66doz" targetRef="Event_0qahgbr" />\n    <bpmn:intermediateThrowEvent id="Event_0nugnpi">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0yc90va</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:linkEventDefinition id="LinkEventDefinition_036cqyk" name="" />\n    </bpmn:intermediateThrowEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0yc90va" sourceRef="Event_0qahgbr" targetRef="Event_0nugnpi" />\n    <bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent id="Event_0igom5c" name="After 5 days">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1r74ggu</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0rv8oax</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="TimerEventDefinition_0ynkx22" />\n    </bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1r74ggu" sourceRef="Gateway_0g66doz" targetRef="Event_0igom5c" />\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_1kti66m" name="Send reminder">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0rv8oax</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1nuv4ku</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0rv8oax" sourceRef="Event_0igom5c" targetRef="Activity_1kti66m" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1nuv4ku" sourceRef="Activity_1kti66m" targetRef="Gateway_13hpysg" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n                 \n                 Corresponding textual process description for the BPMN model "Survey": '}]

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Survey" process begins with a task named "Send Questionnaire". A Task is an atomic Activity within a Process flow. It represents a single unit of work that is not further broken down.

Once the questionnaire is sent, the process reaches an exclusive gateway. A diverging Exclusive Gateway (Decision) is used to create alternative paths within a Process flow, whereas only one of the paths can be taken.

From this gateway, the process moves to an event-based gateway. An Event-Based Gateway represents a branching point in the Process where the alternative paths that follow the Gateway are based on events that occur, rather than the evaluation of expressions using process data (as with an Exclusive or Inclusive Gateway).

After the event-based gateway, the process diverges into two paths. One path leads to an intermediate catch event named "Filled Questionnaire Received". An Intermediate Catch Event is used to model something that happens somewhere between the start and end of a Process. It will affect the flow of the Process, but will not start or (directly) terminate the Process. In this case, the event represents the receipt of the filled questionnaire.

If the filled questionnaire is received, the process moves to an intermediate throw event. An Intermediate Throw Event is used to model something that happens somewhere between the start and end of a Process. It will affect the flow of the Process, but will not start or (directly) terminate the Process. In this case, the event represents the end of the process.

The other path from the event-based gateway leads to an intermediate catch event named "After 5 days". This event represents a timer event that is triggered after 5 days.

If the timer event is triggered, the process moves to a task named "Send reminder". After the reminder is sent, the process returns to the exclusive gateway and the process repeats.

In summary, this process model represents a survey process where a questionnaire is sent, and if the filled questionnaire is received, the process ends. If the filled questionnaire is not received after 5 days, a reminder is sent and the process repeats.
