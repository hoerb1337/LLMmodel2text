A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Planning and Performing Meetings" serialised in XML:\n

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Planning and Performing Meetings" process involves two main pools as participants: "Coordination Unit" and "Committee Members". A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.

The process starts at "Coordination Unit" with the timer start event "Meeting Due". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle. In this case, the timer start event is triggered when a meeting is due. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Meeting Folder". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating a meeting folder.

Once the meeting folder is created, the next task is "Upload All Relevant Documents". This task involves uploading all the necessary documents for the meeting. After the documents are uploaded, an intermediate catch event "1 Week Before Meeting" is triggered. An Intermediate Catch Event is used to model an Event that happens during the course of a Process. These types of Events can affect the flow of the Process, but do not start or (directly) terminate the Process. In this case, the event is triggered one week before the meeting.

After the event is triggered, an intermediate throw event "Remind Members to Read Documentation" is executed. An Intermediate Throw Event is used to model an Event that is generated during the course of a Process. These types of Events can affect the flow of the Process. In this case, the event involves reminding the members to read the documentation.

The next task is "Attends Meeting". This task involves attending the meeting. After the meeting, the task "Prepare Meeting Minutes" is executed. This task involves preparing the meeting minutes. The meeting minutes are then checked in the task "QA Check". If the QA Check is not completed within 5 days, a boundary event "5 days" is triggered. A Boundary Event is an Event that is attached to an Activity and that affects the flow of the Process where it is attached. In this case, the event is triggered if the QA Check is not completed within 5 days.

After the QA Check, an intermediate throw event "Send Minutes To Members" is executed. This event involves sending the meeting minutes to the members. Finally, the process at "Coordination Unit" ends. This is represented by the end event following the "Send Minutes To Members" event. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.

In the "Committee Members" pool, the process starts with an intermediate catch event "Meeting Reminder". This event is triggered when the members receive the meeting reminder. The members then attend the meeting in the task "Meeting Takes Place". After the meeting, an intermediate throw event "Waiting On Meeting Minutes" is executed. This event involves waiting for the meeting minutes. The members then receive the meeting minutes in an intermediate catch event "Send Minutes to Members". Finally, the process at "Committee Members" ends. This is represented by the end event following the "Send Minutes to Members" event.

In summary, the process involves creating a meeting folder, uploading relevant documents, reminding the members to read the documentation, attending the meeting, preparing the meeting minutes, checking the meeting minutes, and sending the meeting minutes to the members.
