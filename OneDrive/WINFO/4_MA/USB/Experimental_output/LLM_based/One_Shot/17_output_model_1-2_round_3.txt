A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Repair Service" serialised in XML:\n                 <?xml

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Repair Service" process involves two main pools as participants: "Customer" and "Computer Repair Service". A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.

The process starts at "Customer" with the start event. A Start Event indicates where a Process will start. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Bring in Defective Computer". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves the customer bringing in the defective computer.

Once the defective computer is brought in, it is sent to the "Computer Repair Service" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Bring in Defective Computer" in the Customer pool to "Prepare Repair Cost Calculation" in the Computer Repair Service pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. 

At the "Computer Repair Service", the task "Prepare Repair Cost Calculation" is performed. After this, the repair cost calculation is sent back to the "Customer" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Prepare Repair Cost Calculation" in the Computer Repair Service pool to "Receive Repair Cost Calculation" in the Customer pool. The task "Receive Repair Cost Calculation" at "Customer" represents the receipt of the repair cost calculation from the "Computer Repair Service".

After receiving the repair cost calculation, the customer has to decide whether the cost is acceptable or not. This decision is represented by an Exclusive Gateway, which is used to model a decision in the Process. If the cost is not acceptable, the customer takes the computer home, which is represented by the task "Take Computer Home". If the cost is acceptable, the customer decides to continue the process, which is represented by the task "Continue Process".

In the meantime, at the "Computer Repair Service", after sending the repair cost calculation, an Event-Based Gateway is used to model a point in the Process where the flow continues based on the occurrence of an event. In this case, the events are either the customer taking the computer home or the customer deciding to continue the process. These events are represented by Intermediate Catch Events, which are used to model a point in the Process where the flow waits for something to happen.

If the customer decides to continue the process, the "Computer Repair Service" performs the task "Repair Computer", which is represented by a Sub-Process. A Sub-Process is a compound Activity that is included within a Process. A Sub-Process is used when the work in the Process is broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the Sub-Process involves checking and repairing the hardware, checking and configuring the software, and testing the system functionality.

Finally, the process at "Computer Repair Service" ends after the system functionality is tested. This is represented by the end event following the "Test System Functionality" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.

In summary, the process involves the customer bringing in the defective computer, the "Computer Repair Service" preparing the repair cost calculation and sending it to the customer, the customer deciding whether to continue the process or take the computer home based on the repair cost calculation, and the "Computer Repair Service" repairing the computer and testing the system functionality if the customer decides to continue the process.
