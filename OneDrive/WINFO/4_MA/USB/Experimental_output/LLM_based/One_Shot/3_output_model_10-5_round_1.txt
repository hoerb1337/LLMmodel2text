A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                \n                BPMN model "Device Takeover Bid" serialised in XML:\n                <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<bpmn:definitions xmlns:bpmn="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL" xmlns:bpmndi="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/DI" xmlns:dc="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DC" xmlns:di="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DI" xmlns:modeler="http://camunda.org/schema/modeler/1.0" id="Definitions_1cnuq53" targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn" exporter="Camunda Modeler" exporterVersion="5.11.0" modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud" modeler:executionPlatformVersion="8.2.0">\n  <bpmn:collaboration id="Collaboration_0ahrrne">\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_10pbjxn" name="MPON" processRef="Process_0wymxfw" />\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_08gtwhj" name="MPOO" processRef="Process_0lyclys" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_1nh9wih" sourceRef="Activity_082b25v" targetRef="Event_167plij" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_0hr220b" sourceRef="Activity_1hxkmec" targetRef="Activity_1cjep32" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_0fxtsnn" sourceRef="Event_0hssnsk" targetRef="Activity_1c2im1f" />\n  </bpmn:collaboration>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0wymxfw" isExecutable="true">\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_1fadcok">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0pm34z9</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:sendTask id="Activity_082b25v" name="Request of a device takeover bid">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0pm34z9</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1tcp2j3</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:sendTask>\n    <bpmn:receiveTask id="Activity_1cjep32" name="Order">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1tcp2j3</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1a7ou2s</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:receiveTask>\n    <bpmn:endEvent id="Event_0hssnsk">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1a7ou2s</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_0raj53p" />\n    </bpmn:endEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0pm34z9" sourceRef="Event_1fadcok" targetRef="Activity_082b25v" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1tcp2j3" sourceRef="Activity_082b25v" targetRef="Activity_1cjep32" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1a7ou2s" sourceRef="Activity_1cjep32" targetRef="Event_0hssnsk" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0lyclys" isExecutable="false">\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_167plij">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1hypkeo</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_1v49l0o" />\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:sendTask id="Activity_1hxkmec" name="Tender of the equipment takeover">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1hypkeo</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_01abwva</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:sendTask>\n    <bpmn:receiveTask id="Activity_1c2im1f" name="Confirmation of order and transmition of master data">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_01abwva</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0a3x5t3</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:receiveTask>\n    <bpmn:endEvent id="Event_064uck0">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0a3x5t3</bpmn:incoming>\n    </bpmn:endEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1hypkeo" sourceRef="Event_167plij" targetRef="Activity_1hxkmec" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_01abwva" sourceRef="Activity_1hxkmec" targetRef="Activity_1c2im1f" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0a3x5t3" sourceRef="Activity_1c2im1f" targetRef="Event_064uck0" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n                \n                Corresponding textual process description for the BPMN model "Device Takeover Bid": '}]

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Device Takeover Bid" process involves two main pools as participants: "MPON" and "MPOO". A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.

The process starts at "MPON" with the start event. A start event is triggered when the process is initiated. In this case, the start event triggers the first task "Request of a device takeover bid". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves requesting a device takeover bid.

Once the request is made, it is sent to the "MPOO" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Request of a device takeover bid" in the MPON pool to the start event in the MPOO pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. 

Upon receiving the request, "MPOO" initiates the task "Tender of the equipment takeover". This task involves tendering the equipment takeover. After this task, a message is sent back to "MPON" which is represented by the message flow from "Tender of the equipment takeover" in the MPOO pool to "Order" in the MPON pool. 

The task "Order" at "MPON" represents the ordering of the equipment. After the order is placed, a message is sent to "MPOO" which is represented by the end event in the MPON pool and the task "Confirmation of order and transmission of master data" in the MPOO pool. 

Finally, the process at "MPOO" ends after the confirmation of the order and transmission of master data. This is represented by the end event following the "Confirmation of order and transmission of master data" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.

In summary, the process involves requesting a device takeover bid at "MPON", sending it to the "MPOO", tendering the equipment takeover at the "MPOO", sending an order back to "MPON", and confirming the order and transmitting the master data at "MPOO".
