A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Scheduling Meetings" serialised in XML:\n                 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<bpmn:definitions xmlns:bpmn="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL" xmlns:bpmndi="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/DI" xmlns:dc="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DC" xmlns:di="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DI" xmlns:modeler="http://camunda.org/schema/modeler/1.0" id="Definitions_188llkx" targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn" exporter="Camunda Modeler" exporterVersion="5.11.0" modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud" modeler:executionPlatformVersion="8.2.0">\n  <bpmn:collaboration id="Collaboration_0qstv3q">\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_09vqbn7" name="Town Planning Authority" processRef="Process_0b65nd1" />\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_1v33s1r" name="Committee Members" processRef="Process_12vl4ov" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_1n4ydrd" sourceRef="Event_0uch8i4" targetRef="Event_0y6y1kg" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_1ynlsbb" sourceRef="Event_14ufn11" targetRef="Event_1kfhatq" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_0qb31xt" sourceRef="Event_1rrwfuo" targetRef="Event_1wul8vg" />\n  </bpmn:collaboration>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0b65nd1" isExecutable="true">\n    <bpmn:laneSet id="LaneSet_1btuwhr">\n      <bpmn:lane id="Lane_0uv7pcm" name="Coordination Unit">\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_0wnrdxk</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_04ccjl1</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_0oqrb21</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_0g65qgd</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_0uch8i4</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n      </bpmn:lane>\n      <bpmn:lane id="Lane_1jti4sp" name="Support Officer">\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_1nzduog</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_1abqyd8</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_1rrwfuo</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Activity_035f2a2</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n        <bpmn:flowNodeRef>Event_1kfhatq</bpmn:flowNodeRef>\n      </bpmn:lane>\n    </bpmn:laneSet>\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_0wnrdxk" name="November">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0iaif8j</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="TimerEventDefinition_0mb26q3" />\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_04ccjl1" name="Draft Dates">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0iaif8j</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0iji5hf</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_0oqrb21" name="Enter Onto Next Years Calendar">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0iji5hf</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0yayisn</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:task>\n    <bpmn:task id="Activity_1nzduog" name="Checks &#38;

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Scheduling Meetings" process involves two main pools as participants: "Town Planning Authority" and "Committee Members". A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.

The process starts at "Town Planning Authority" with the timer start event "November". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle. In this case, the timer start event is triggered in November. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Draft Dates". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves drafting dates for meetings.

Once the dates are drafted, they are entered onto next year's calendar. This is represented by the task "Enter Onto Next Years Calendar". After the dates are entered onto the calendar, the "Support Officer" checks and suggests updates, which is represented by the task "Checks & Suggests Updates".

After the updates are suggested, the "Coordination Unit" finalizes the calendar schedule, which is represented by the task "Finalize Calendar Schedule". Once the schedule is finalized, it is sent to the "Committee Members" via a message flow. This is represented by the intermediate throw event "Send Schedule to Members". An Intermediate Throw Event is used to show where Messages, Signals, Timers, Errors, Compensations, or Conditions are expected within the Process.

The "Committee Members" receive the meeting schedule, which is represented by the start event "Receive Meeting Schedule" within the sub-process "Members Check Schedules". A Sub-Process is a compound Activity that is included within a Process. A Sub-Process is used when the work in the Process is broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the sub-process involves the committee members checking their schedules for conflicts.

If there are any conflicts, the committee members advise of schedule conflicts, which is represented by the intermediate throw event "Advise of Schedule Conflicts". The "Town Planning Authority" receives the schedule conflicts, which is represented by the intermediate catch event "Receive Schedule Conflicts". An Intermediate Catch Event is used to show where Messages, Signals, Timers, Errors, Compensations, or Conditions are expected within the Process.

After receiving the schedule conflicts, the "Support Officer" updates group calendars, which is represented by the task "Updates Group Calendars". Once the group calendars are updated, the final schedule is sent to the "Committee Members", which is represented by the intermediate throw event "Send Final Schedule To Members".

Finally, the process at "Town Planning Authority" ends after the final schedule is sent. This is represented by the end event following the "Send Final Schedule To Members" event. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.

In summary, the process involves drafting dates for meetings at "Town Planning Authority", entering them onto next year's calendar, checking and suggesting updates, finalizing the calendar schedule, sending the schedule to the "Committee Members", receiving schedule conflicts, updating group calendars, sending the final schedule to the "Committee Members", and ending the process.
