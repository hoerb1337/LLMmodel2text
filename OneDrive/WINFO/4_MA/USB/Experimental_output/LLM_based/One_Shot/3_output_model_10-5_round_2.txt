A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration.\n\nThe process starts at "Assembler AG" with the timer start event "1st each month". A timer start event is triggered by a defined time-date or cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9am). In this case, the timer start event is triggered on the 1st of each month. After the start event is triggered, the first task is "Create Order". A Task is an atomic Activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process detail. In this case, the task involves creating an order. \n\nOnce the order is created, it is sent to the "Supplier" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Create Order" in the Assembler AG pool to "Process Order" in the Supplier pool. A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Messages between two Participants that are prepared to send and receive them. While the Assembler Ag then waits for the invoice, the "Supplier" processes the order, which is represented by the task "Process Order".\n\nAfter processing the order, the "Supplier" sends an invoice to "Assembler AG" in the task "Send Invoice". This is represented by the message flow from "Send Invoice" in the "Supplier" pool to "Receive Invoice" in the Assembler AG pool. The task "Receive Invoice" at "Assembler AG" represents the receipt of the invoice from the "Supplier".\n\nFinally, the process at "Assembler AG" ends after the invoice is received. This is represented by the end event following the "Receive Invoice" task. The End Event indicates where a Process will end.\n\nIn summary, the process involves creating an order at "Assembler AG", sending it to the "Supplier", processing the order at the "Supplier", sending an invoice back to "Assembler AG", and receiving the invoice at "Assembler AG".\n                 \n                 BPMN model "Device Takeover Bid" serialised in XML:\n                 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<bpmn:definitions xmlns:bpmn="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL" xmlns:bpmndi="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/DI" xmlns:dc="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DC" xmlns:di="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20100524/DI" xmlns:modeler="http://camunda.org/schema/modeler/1.0" id="Definitions_1cnuq53" targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn" exporter="Camunda Modeler" exporterVersion="5.11.0" modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud" modeler:executionPlatformVersion="8.2.0">\n  <bpmn:collaboration id="Collaboration_0ahrrne">\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_10pbjxn" name="MPON" processRef="Process_0wymxfw" />\n    <bpmn:participant id="Participant_08gtwhj" name="MPOO" processRef="Process_0lyclys" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_1nh9wih" sourceRef="Activity_082b25v" targetRef="Event_167plij" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_0hr220b" sourceRef="Activity_1hxkmec" targetRef="Activity_1cjep32" />\n    <bpmn:messageFlow id="Flow_0fxtsnn" sourceRef="Event_0hssnsk" targetRef="Activity_1c2im1f" />\n  </bpmn:collaboration>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0wymxfw" isExecutable="true">\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_1fadcok">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0pm34z9</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:sendTask id="Activity_082b25v" name="Request of a device takeover bid">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0pm34z9</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1tcp2j3</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:sendTask>\n    <bpmn:receiveTask id="Activity_1cjep32" name="Order">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1tcp2j3</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1a7ou2s</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:receiveTask>\n    <bpmn:endEvent id="Event_0hssnsk">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1a7ou2s</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_0raj53p" />\n    </bpmn:endEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0pm34z9" sourceRef="Event_1fadcok" targetRef="Activity_082b25v" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1tcp2j3" sourceRef="Activity_082b25v" targetRef="Activity_1cjep32" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1a7ou2s" sourceRef="Activity_1cjep32" targetRef="Event_0hssnsk" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n  <bpmn:process id="Process_0lyclys" isExecutable="false">\n    <bpmn:startEvent id="Event_167plij">\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_1hypkeo</bpmn:outgoing>\n      <bpmn:messageEventDefinition id="MessageEventDefinition_1v49l0o" />\n    </bpmn:startEvent>\n    <bpmn:sendTask id="Activity_1hxkmec" name="Tender of the equipment takeover">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_1hypkeo</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_01abwva</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:sendTask>\n    <bpmn:receiveTask id="Activity_1c2im1f" name="Confirmation of order and transmition of master data">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_01abwva</bpmn:incoming>\n      <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_0a3x5t3</bpmn:outgoing>\n    </bpmn:receiveTask>\n    <bpmn:endEvent id="Event_064uck0">\n      <bpmn:incoming>Flow_0a3x5t3</bpmn:incoming>\n    </bpmn:endEvent>\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_1hypkeo" sourceRef="Event_167plij" targetRef="Activity_1hxkmec" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_01abwva" sourceRef="Activity_1hxkmec" targetRef="Activity_1c2im1f" />\n    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_0a3x5t3" sourceRef="Activity_1c2im1f" targetRef="Event_064uck0" />\n  </bpmn:process>\n                 \n                 Corresponding textual process description for the BPMN model "Device Takeover Bid": '}]

######### Generated Textual Process Description #########

The "Device Takeover Bid" process involves two main participants: "MPON" and "MPOO". 

The process starts at "MPON" with a start event. A start event indicates where a process will start. After the start event, the first task is "Request of a device takeover bid". This task is a Send Task, which is a type of task that sends a message to another process. 

Once the request is sent, it is received by "MPOO" via a message flow. This is represented by the message flow from "Request of a device takeover bid" in the MPON pool to the start event in the MPOO pool. 

After receiving the request, "MPOO" performs the task "Tender of the equipment takeover". This is another Send Task, which sends a message back to "MPON". This is represented by the message flow from "Tender of the equipment takeover" in the MPOO pool to "Order" in the MPON pool. 

The task "Order" at "MPON" represents the receipt of the tender and the placement of an order. After the order is placed, a message is sent back to "MPOO". This is represented by the end event following the "Order" task, which has a Message Event Definition. A Message Event Definition indicates that the event is triggered by the receipt of a message. 

The message from "MPON" is received by "MPOO" in the task "Confirmation of order and transmission of master data". This is a Receive Task, which is a type of task that waits for a message to arrive from another process. 

Finally, the process at "MPOO" ends after the confirmation and transmission of master data. This is represented by the end event following the "Confirmation of order and transmission of master data" task. 

In summary, the process involves requesting a device takeover bid at "MPON", tendering the equipment takeover at "MPOO", ordering at "MPON", and confirming the order and transmitting master data at "MPOO".
